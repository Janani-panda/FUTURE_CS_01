# 🔍 Web Application Security Testing
This repository contains the outcome of my internship task under Future Interns, where I performed Web Application Security Testing on a real-world vulnerable site, Narayana Health, using the UpGuard Online Scanner.
# 💾 Task Overview
"During my cybersecurity internship with Future Interns, I completed a hands-on security assessment task involving a deliberately vulnerable web application. The goal was to simulate real-world security testing in a controlled environment, allowing me to safely identify common vulnerabilities using a lightweight automated scanner.

This exercise helped me develop key skills in:

- Analyzing web application misconfigurations

- Detecting security risks using scanning tools

Documenting findings in a professional Security Assessment Report (SAR) with evidence, screenshots, and remediation recommendations.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in vulnerability assessment and reporting—essential skills for a cybersecurity professional."
